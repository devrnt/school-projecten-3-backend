# School Project 3 - Talentcoach - Backend

Our second school project was seperated in a backend, frontend and a mobile application part. The frontend is made in `Angular`.
This project was our final project and was very advanced. We had to keep contact with our customer by ourself.

In Belgium we have a school platform called `Smartschool` in the Flanders, this platform is used by teachers to publish their school grades, upload tasks, keep in touch by email...

This project was to create an alternative for Smartschool, it was more focused on giving ratings and set a capability to 'accomplished'.

This repo contains all the code that was used for the backend. Both the Android and Angular application were in communincation with this backend.
